# Pygame Experimentation

A simple game project to create a 2D top down RTS style game.  I started out following a guide but found it was incomplete, no longer had a working link to source code, and was also written for python 2.  I updated examples for python 3 initially and did some experimentation with the configurations and map drawing.

# Original Tutorial

# Tileset

I included a [tileset](https://tazmoe.itch.io/sci-fi-rougelike) that is free on itch.io because of the original for the tutorial being unavailable.  I plan to eventually replace with a homemade tileset.

# Todo

1. new tileset
2. sprite tiles
3. Implement basic game loop in the level loader in a dedicated game object
4. Update level loader to load a level file supplied at launch
5. Update tileset loader to load a tileset supplied at launch
6. Implement a player character and movement in the game loop
